## Questions
1. What you technologies you used and why (if you only used html, css, and js please explain any templates or frameworks you may have used i.e. bootstrap)
  * I recently learned how to use ReactJs and I decided that I wanted to further my understanding of React as well as challenge myself. I chose to use React and React-bootstrap in order to create this webpage because together they create dynamic and impressionable pages.
2. Any struggles you faced when developing with technology you chose
  * I had never worked with bootstrap before so I was unfamiliar with everything it can do so I decided to spend some time researching. I also had little experience with animations in ReactJs and CSS and would love to learn more about both.
3. What you enjoyed the most and why
  * I thoroughly enjoyed learning how to do aspects that I had never done before. I enjoyed researching and implementing features like modals, a carousel slider, and stick buttons. I learned so much from this project about front-end development that I am confident I can continue to learn and improve.
